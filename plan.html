<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this site is to provide information to the customers without having the need for them to wait for the store to open and come by or call  every now and then to ask simple questions. By reducing the trouble of having customers come to the store, this site would increase the number of new potential customers.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The site's success can be evaluated by comparing the attendance of the event and the number of costumes being ordered before and after the site is published.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The main target audience for this website is teens and young adults who are interested in cosplays. This site is simply designed for easy navigation with pictures of children and teens included to better relate to the target audience .</p>
